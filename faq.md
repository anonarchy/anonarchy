# Anonarchy FAQ

## What is this for?

Anonymously posting to any location.

## How anonymous am I?

Your identity is not associated on our sever with your posts and comments. In the future you will only be able to delete a post from the same device that created it (you are given a key). If you delete that key, then you will have no association whatsoever. If you vote, that vote is associated with your identity, but is encrypted. After two months, that association disappears and you can vote on the post a second time if you want.

## Why do I have to make an account?

We want you to prove that you are not a robot and prevent infinite voting.

## Is there censorship?

No. But there are specific types of speech that are illegal in the United States and we will be required by law to remove those posts/comments. We highly suggest you don't post such things for our sakes and yours. But we will have no means of determining who you are. We'll just have to delete those posts (We think. Lawyers contact us if you think otherwise). We retain the right to delete spam.

## Why is this better than X site/app that does the same thing?

It's [completely open-source](https://github.com/anonarchy/anonarchy), so anyone can verify that it's truly anonymous.

## How does post ranking work?

Posts are ranked on a combination of time, votes, and distance from your current location.

## I'm deeply offended by something someone wrote. What are you going to do about it?

Nothing.

## I am an NSA agent, how to I get your users' information?

There's no way to know who posted what from our database or our servers. Your best bet would be to monitor IP addresses. (Paranoid people should use VPNs)

## I'm a lawyer. You're doing something illegal!

uhhh, please tell us what and how we can remedy it.

## How can I contribute?

We're [completely open-source](https://github.com/anonarchy/anonarchy) so you can write code for us and we won't pay you. You can also [donate](https://github.com/anonypost/anonypost/blob/master/donate.md)! We need money to keep the servers running. And maybe, one day, eat.
